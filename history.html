				The Samurai's roots can be traced all the way back to the <i>Kokin Wakashū</i>. This collection of <i>waka</i> poems is thought to have been conceived<br>
				by Emperor Uda during the early 10th century.<br><br>
				Surprisingly, the term <i>samurai</i> did not always denote such a skilled warrior as it does today. It's original origins are in the
				word <i>saburau</i> which simply dictates an upper-class citizen of a Japan.<br><br>
				By the end of the 12th century, the term samurai had become a word used to describe warriors that followed a set of rules known as <i>bushido</i>.
				Bushido literally translates into "<i>the way of the warrior</i>", and can be described as closely related to the concept of chivalry. Influenced by 
				Shinto and Zen Buddhism, bushido has been described as "<i>The law of honor, obedience, duty and self-sacrifice</i>"<br><br>
				Even thought the samurai numbered less than 10% of the Japanese population, their teachings can still be found today in modern philosphy and martial arts.

							<strong>Asuka Period: 538 - 710 AD</strong>
							<p>The earliest period of time we can refer to in terms of the samurai, the Asuka period gave birth to <i>The Taihō Code</i>. This scroll dictated that
							everyone in Japan was to be assigned a classification. Rank 1 being the highest advisor to the Emperor, and rank six the samurai who dealt with
							day to day affairs. The samurai where not warriors per-say at this point, but instead men in charge of completing many generalized tasks.</p><br>
							
							<strong>Heian Period: 794 - 1185 AD</strong>
							<p>In the late 8th and 9th centuries, Emperor Kammu wished to expand his rule to Honshu. However, the armies he sent lacked the motivation and discipline
							and all failed in their task. Kammu introduced the title of <i>Shogun</i>, and began to rely on regional clans skilled in archery to conquer his enemies. Since the 
							introduction of Shoguns, or regional military commanders - the control of power had been spread throughout Japan. Some of these Shogun where greedy, and 
							imposed large taxes running many hard-working citizens out of business and taking their land.

						<strong>Heiji Rebellion of 1160</strong>
							<p>In 1160, a civial war erupted in Japan. This war was fueled by the desire for power and land in the <i>Fujiwara</i>,<i>Minamoto</i> and <i>Taira clans</i>. <br>
							The winner, Taira no Kiyomori, leader of the Taira clan established a samurai dominated government and reduced the Emperor to a political figurehead.</p><br>
							<strong>Gempei War - 1180</strong>
							<p>This rule did not last long before Taira and Minamoto where at war once again in 1180. This time, Minamoto's samurai had the upperhand and concluded victory
							by 1190. The Minamoto one again changed the course of Japanese government to that of a <i>Bakufu</i>, or "Tent Government". A reference to the tent's that samurai lived in,
							as Japan would now be ruled by its militaries. </p>
							<p>Over time, the samurai clans would become warriors of nobility. The samurai began to study calligraphy, poetry, and music. At this point in time, the 
							Shogun and samurai where the controlling forces in Japan.

						<strong>1100 AD</strong>
						<p>Between 1100, and 1200 the samurai grew and fought. Zen Buddhism began to spread throughout Japan, and the samurai where early adopters of this teaching.
						Zen Buddhism had a special place with the samurai, as it helped them shape their standards of conduct, and overcome the fear of death and killing.<p>
						<strong>1200 AD</strong>
						<p>In 1274, China sent a force of 40,000 men and 900 ships to invade Japan in northern Kyushu. Japan sent a mere 10,000 samurai to meet this threat. Fortunately for Japan,
						thunderstorms occurred throughout the invasion sinking Chinese ships and easing the fight for Japan. The Chinese army eventually retreated. However, in their wake they threw
						bombs, which is the first recorded use of gunpowder in Japan.<br>
						The Japanese realized another threat from the sea was possible, so they constructed a great stone barrier around Hakata Bay in 1276. Completed in 1277, the wall was 20km wide and would later 
						server as a strong defensive point against the Mongols. The Mongols tried to arrange trade in a peaceful manner, but every envoy sent to Japan was executed. This set the stage for
						one of the largest battles in Japan.<br>
						In 1281, a Mongol army of 140,000 men and 5,000 ships attacked Japan at Kyushu. Kyushu was defended by an army of 40,000 Japanese. However, a typhoon struck just as the Mongols began to attack,
						sinking ships and causing the Mongols to retreat.<br>
						After these instances of the Japanese being saved by weather, this became known as kami-no-kaze, which literally translates into "wind of the gods", or "divine wind".</p>
						<strong>1300 AD</strong>
						<p>In the 14th century, a blacksmith named Masamune developed a two layer structure of hard and soft steel for use in swords. This gave improved cutting power and endurance, and would lead
						to creation of the Katana.<p>
						<strong>1500 AD</strong>
						<p>A Chinese pirate ship was boarded in 1543, and on board was a matchlock gun, <i>arquebus</i>. The Japanese would take this, and within 10 years reverse engineer the weapon. Producing their own 
						firearms. By the end of the 16th century, over one hundred thousand matchlock guns existed throughout Japan.</p>

						<strong>1586</strong>
							<p>In 1596 Toyotomi Hideyoshi created a law that the samurai caste become codified as permenant and hereditary. Non samurai where forbidden to carry weapons, thereby
							ending social mobility in Japan.</p>
							<strong>1592 & 1597</strong>
							<p>In 1592, and than again in 1597 - Toyotomi Hideyoshi decided to invade China through Korea. He mobolized an army of 160,000 peasents and samurai.
							Taking advantage of the new rifle, the <i>arquebus</i> Japan gained major masses of land and took over most of Korea. Shimazu Yoshihiro led 7,000 samurai
							past that point, and defeated tens of thousands of soliders of Ming and Korean allied forces at the Battle of Sacheon in 1598.</p>

							<strong>Edo Period Japan</strong>
							<p>During the Edo period in Japan, since no warfare had occured since the 17th century - samurai gradually lost their military function. 
							But the end of the Tokugawa era, samurai paired with katana and wakizashi, but only to symbolize power rather than to be used in daily life. The samurai 
							class was now required to become educated, and bushido was formalized by several influential families and leaders. Bushido did not change much from the 13th
							century to the 19th century, and transcended time and location.</p>

							<strong>Decline of the Samurai</strong>
							<p>In 1853, Commodore Mathew Perry's U.S. Navy steamship opened fire on Japan. An attempt to force Japan to trade with the United States. Japan gave in to
							Mathew Perry's requests, and traded with the United States - resulting in a modernized samurai army and navy force. The last appearence of the samurai was 
							in 1867, when samurai from Choshu and Satsuma defeated the Shogunate forced in favour of a new Emperor.<br>
							The new Emperor, Meiji abolished the samurai's right to be the only armed force in exchange for a more modern western style army. Samurai became Shizoku, and
							retained some of their salaries but could no longer carry Katana in public or execute commoners who paid them disrespect.<br>
							The samurai class was abolished in the 19th century. However, its spirit still lives on today.</p>
