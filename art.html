				As the samurai became more cultured: music, art and philosophy would begin to become a daily aspect of their training. The study of Zen Buddhism, led to the adaptation
				of the <i>kokyu</i>, alongside of several other artistic and musical mediums.

							<strong>Kokyu</strong>
							<p>
							The kokyu is a Japanese stringed instrument similar to a shamisen, it is played with a bow - similar to a fiddle. The kokyu is held upright on one's knee, 
							and has only three strings. The body is made of wood, but the bow would be made from hair plucked from a horse's tail. This instrument was used both for 
							recreation and entertainment, and frequently played in a trio.
							
							</p>
							<strong>Shakuhachi</strong>
							<p>
								Literally translating into "1.8 foot", the shakuhachi was a large wooden flute that originated from the monks of Zen Buddhism. Adopted by the samurai
								who typically followed the teachings of Zen, this instrument would be built from bamboo and played alongside many other instruments including the kokyu.
								It is assumed the very earliest origins of this instrument are china in the 6th century. This instrument is frequently used today in films such as 
								<i>The Last Samurai</i> to create a samurai-esque ambience.

							<strong>Calligraphy</strong>
							<p>
								A common and admirable pastime, calligraphy took years of practice and dedication to master. A perfect parallel to the samurai training regime.
								Calligraphy literally means "beautiful writing", and typically took place in ink - but can be found in paint as well. This style of writing is thought to have originated
								in 600 BC Rome, carved on stone. Over time, this artistic writing migrated to China, and finally Japan. Japanese calligraphy is traditionally made with an inkstick between 50 and 100 years old,
								mulberry paper, cloth, paperweights, brushes and seals.
