				The samurai where known as masters of swordsmanship and weaponsmithing. However, their armour was unique and effective as well. It took the samurai several centuries 
				to perfect amour that allowed mobility, while being resistant and durable enough to be worn in battle. This evolution can be seen as the pre-samurai era Japanese warriors
				would wear heavy metal plate armour that allowed for little mobility. But by the 12th century, the introduction of kozane armour, or "scaled armour" let the samurai
				build a reputation of mobility and defence.

							<strong>Ō-yoroi</strong>
							<p>
							O-yoroi armour first appeared in the 10th century and was widespread by the 12th century. It was designed for cavalry archers, and did not allow much movement 
							for the samurai do to its stiff nature. Because it lacked flexibility, this wooden armour fell out of favour by the 15th century when the samurai switched to mostly infantry tactics.
							
							</p>
							<strong>Dō-maru</strong>
							<p>
							Do-maru style Kozane armour became popular with Japanese samurai around the 11th century, and became the most popular style of armour by the 15th century. Do-maru armour included
							an armoured skirt and was constructed by small scales of leather or metal laced together with cord. Because it offered more mobility than the O-yoroi armor, this armour was a favorite amoung samurai.

							<strong>Hishinui dou</strong>
							<p>After the introduction of firearms in Japan, armour had to become more durable for the samurai. The Hinshinui duo had rows of prominent leather knots on the chest peice, providing extra durability 
							against firearms, without a large reduction in mobility. </p>
							<strong>Hotoke duo</strong>
							<p>For situations where even stronger armour was required, this armour adds a metal plate on top of the knotted leather breastplate for maximum protection against bullets. This was frequently
							riveted for maximum durability instead of laced like most of its predecessors.</p>

							<strong>Kusari</strong>
							<p>The Japanese also used their metalworking skills to build high-quality chainmail. The samurai used <i>kusari</i> chainmail to cover everything from gloves to <i>tabi</i> boots.
							The two variations on traditional Japanese kusari are <i>so gusari</i> "square pattern chainmail" and <i>hana gusari</i> "hexagonal chainmail". These could be doubled up, and it was possible to make them
							bullet resistant. The links where lacquered black to prevent rusting, and always stitched onto leather or cloth. Somtimes concealed entirely inside two layers of cloth.</p>
							<strong>Kabuto</strong>
							<p>
							Kabuto helemets date back to the fifth century (before the samurai class). Called <i>mabizashi-tsuke kabuto</i>, literally "visor attached helmet" - the style of these helmets is thought to have originated from
							China or Korea. Later this become an iconic piece of the samurai wardrobe and played a symbolic role as well. To take off one's kabuto was synonymous with surrender.
